# An addon to manage options specific to sources. To use it, you need to create a `.dgit/sources_options` file.
# This file must contain a Json object where the source URLs are the keys, and the values will be given to in
# return to the call of {[]} with the corresponding source. Example:
# ```
# "https://github.com/jrfaller/diggit": {
#   "name": "An option object for the diggit source.",
#   "useful": true
# }
# ```
